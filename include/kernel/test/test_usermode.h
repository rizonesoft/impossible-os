/* ============================================================================
 * test_usermode.h -- Kernel-side launcher for user-mode test binaries
 *
 * Scans C:\ for `test_*.exe` files (deployed by the user-mode test
 * framework's Makefile rule), runs each in its own task, collects exit
 * codes, and emits a `[UTEST] <name>: PASS|FAIL (exit=N)` line per
 * binary plus a summary `[UTEST] N passed, N failed of N total`.
 *
 * Triggered from boot_tests_run() when boot.conf has `test=1`. The
 * launcher is a no-op when test=0 (boot_tests_run skips the call) or
 * when no `test_*.exe` files exist on the disk.
 *
 * Each binary runs as a separate kernel task via the canonical
 * task_create + utest_loader_func + task_exec pattern (mirrors how
 * boot_desktop spawns cmd.exe). The launcher waits for each binary
 * with task_waitpid before scanning the next, so binaries run
 * sequentially and isolated from one another.
 *
 * The §4 `utest_filter=<name|glob>` boot.conf parameter is honoured by
 * test_usermode_set_filter() once §4 ships the boot.conf field; today
 * the launcher always runs every test_*.exe match.
