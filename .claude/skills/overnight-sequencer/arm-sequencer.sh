# arm-sequencer.sh -- arm the unattended overnight sequencer for impossible-os.
#
# Drives the REPO-VENDORED scheduler (scripts/overnight/overnight-arm.sh +
# overnight-launch.sh -- no external plugin dependency since 2026-06-16) and:
#   1. redirects the headless launch onto the repo-owned overnight-sequencer
#      skill via the .claude/state/sequencer-armed marker (run_phase_guard.py
#      hard-blocks anything else until overnight-sequencer is invoked);
#   2. forces --mode bypassPermissions + a 10-min pure-failover watchdog;
#   3. turns ChromeMCP OFF at the systemd-unit level for THIS repo only (a
#      per-unit env drop-in; the vendored launcher honors OVERNIGHT_NO_CHROMEMCP
#      and skips the lane logic entirely, so kernel runs make no browser noise).
#
# Usage:
#   bash .claude/skills/overnight-sequencer/arm-sequencer.sh [--at "<calendar>"]
#   bash .claude/skills/overnight-sequencer/arm-sequencer.sh --with-browser   # gh-pages
