# TODO-13 -- TPM Measured Boot, PCR Replay & Attestation

> **Goal:** Complete the measured-boot trust chain from firmware through bootloader and kernel. The bootloader retrieves the TCG event log and the kernel parses it, but true integrity requires PCR replay, TPM2 PCR reads, baseline enrollment, sealed storage, and diagnostics. This TODO turns the current TPM presence/event-count code into a full boot integrity feature.
> **Current state (2026-06-12):** `retrieve_tpm_event_log()` copies the event log into `boot_info`, `tpm_init()` parses enough to count events and identify hash algorithms, and `tpm_integrity_init()` is a stub that reports `BOOT_INTEGRITY_NO_CRYPTO`. §2 shipped the TPM2 command transport (`tpm2_submit()` in `src/kernel/tpm_transport.c`: TIS/CRB, ACPI TPM2 discovery, conditional Startup, Phase 1 init). Still missing: PCR read (§3), PCR replay (§4), baseline enrollment (§6), TPM NV storage (§7), attestation report (§9).

## Inputs

- [`include/kernel/tpm.h`](../../include/kernel/tpm.h)
- [`src/kernel/tpm.c`](../../src/kernel/tpm.c)
- [`src/boot/uefi/bootx64.c`](../../src/boot/uefi/bootx64.c)
- [`include/kernel/boot_info.h`](../../include/kernel/boot_info.h)
- -> XREF: `TODO-02-uefi-hardening-secureboot.md §3-§6` -- Secure Boot state and signed bootloader
- -> XREF: `TODO-01-boot-protocol-abi-handoff.md §4` -- TPM event log as typed boot payload
- -> XREF: `../02-kernel-core/TODO-03-kernel-libraries.md §3` -- cryptographic primitives/CSPRNG dependency
- -> XREF: `../02-kernel-core/TODO-19-code-integrity-trust-policy.md` -- image trust policy consumes measured boot
- -> XREF: `TODO-07-boot-entry-store-menu-policy.md §3, §9` -- §9 attestation export carries the boot-entry selected id and selection-reason code from TODO-07 §3

## Outcome

- TPM 1.2/2.0 event logs are parsed robustly and preserved for diagnostics.
- TPM2 PCR values can be read and compared against replayed event-log values.
- First-boot baseline enrollment stores golden measurements securely.
- Boot integrity status is available in Registry, BlackBox, system settings, and policy gates.
- Disk unlock, code integrity, and recovery can use measured-boot state.

## 1. Harden TCG Event-Log Parser

- [ ] Parse TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 crypto-agile logs without unaligned reads.
- [ ] Preserve per-event PCR index, type, digest list, and event payload metadata.
- [ ] Reject truncation with explicit offsets and status codes.
- [ ] Export event summaries to `X:\Diag\tpm-events.json`.
- [ ] When the bootloader copies the TCG event log, publish a typed payload descriptor of type `BOOT_PAYLOAD_TPM_EVENT_LOG` (enum in [`include/kernel/boot_info.h`](../../include/kernel/boot_info.h)) pointing at the copy so TODO-01 §4's overlap validator retains the region alongside boot_info / rt_mmap / USB DMA / framebuffer. -> XREF: [`01-boot-platform/TODO-01 §4`](TODO-01-boot-protocol-abi-handoff.md#4-optional-payload-descriptor-array)
- [ ] Commit: `"tpm: harden measured boot event log parser"`

**Test checkpoint:** Kernel unit fixtures parse a TPM 1.2 SHA-1 log and a TPM 2.0 crypto-agile (multi-bank) log with zero unaligned reads; a truncated log is rejected with an explicit byte offset + status code (not a silent stop); `X:\Diag\tpm-events.json` lists per-event PCR index / type / digest count; the bootloader copy publishes a `BOOT_PAYLOAD_TPM_EVENT_LOG` descriptor that TODO-01 §4's overlap validator retains. Platforms: kernel unit tests (fixtures) + QEMU swtpm KVM smoke; bare metal (test laptop fTPM).

## 2. TPM2 Command Transport

- [x] Discovery (`tpm_transport.c` `tpm_transport_init()`): ACPI TPM2 table start method 6/7, TIS fixed-base fallback, UC MMIO; methods 2/8 degrade -> XREF: `04-drivers-hardware/TODO-03` §1 (item: "TPM2 ACPI start method (2/8) via ACPICA").
- [x] Locality 0 held from init; TIS FIFO write AND read chunked by live burstCount with Expect/dataAvail checks; CRB cmdReady/START/goIdle handshake with size-capped mapped buffers.
- [x] PTP TIMEOUT_A-D TSC poll deadlines (iteration fallback when freq unknown); timeout = sticky transport failure, boot continues; Phase 1 init after `acpi_init()` per design review.
- [x] TPM2_Startup never perturbs firmware-owned state: GetCapability probe first, Startup(CLEAR) only on TPM_RC_INITIALIZE; vendor logged.
- [x] `tpm2_submit()` whole-transaction serialized (concurrent caller gets TPM_T_ERR_BUSY); response bounded by caller cap + TPM_T_MAX_RESPONSE; response tag vocabulary enforced.
- [x] Unblocked `01-boot-platform/TODO-12` §4 (TPM2_GetRandom) -- consumer note updated in the same commit.
- [x] Commit: `"tpm: add TPM2 command transport"`

**Test checkpoint:** With QEMU `-tpm` (swtpm) serial shows `TPM2 transport up (TIS|CRB, vendor XXXX)`; without a TPM the log shows `no TPM2 table and no firmware TPM; transport not started` and boot continues (verified live on KVM smoke, POST16 0x1055). Known TCG TPM-init freeze (`project_tcg_tpm_freeze`) must not regress: transport init is Phase 1, after the freeze point. QEMU WHPX, QEMU TCG, VirtualBox, bare metal (test laptop fTPM).

> **Test runner:** `scripts\debug\kernel\run-security-tests.bat` (SUITE=security) | 2 transport suites (marshaling + fake-TIS submit) in `test_tpm_transport.c`, 0 failures

> **Notes:**
> - Shipped `include/kernel/tpm_transport.h` + `src/kernel/tpm_transport.c` (TIS/FIFO burst-chunked + CRB, ACPI TPM2 discovery, conditional Startup) + Phase 1 wiring in `boot_interrupts.c` (POST16 0x1054/0x1055).
> - Runs once in Phase 1 after ACPI + boot timing; `tpm2_submit()` is the single public command path, whole-transaction serialized, sticky-failed on wedge.
> - Downstream: TODO-12 §4 (TPM RNG) consumes `tpm2_submit()`; §3 PCR read and §7 NV index build on the same API; Codex design + test-coverage adoptions in the section commit.
> - Canonical contract doc: `include/kernel/tpm_transport.h` header comment (phase + concurrency contracts).
> - Scope boundary: ACPI-start methods (2/8) degrade until ACPICA lands (owner: `04-drivers-hardware/TODO-03` §1); event-log parsing stays in `tpm.c` (§1); PCR commands are §3.

> **Verified:** 2026-06-12 | commit `8ae51bf1` | 6/6 items | build OK | smoke PASS (KVM 2.530s)
> **Accepted:** [M] ACPI start methods 2/8 degrade-with-WARN until an AML interpreter exists -> XREF: 04-drivers-hardware/TODO-03 §1 (item: "TPM2 ACPI start method (2/8)" at line 80)
> **Deferred:** [L] CRB submit path lacks a fake-buffer unit seam (validated live via swtpm checkpoint) -> XREF: 01-boot-platform/TODO-13 §11 (item: "Fake-CRB buffer seam + unit suite for crb_submit()" at line 84)
> **Quality reviewed:** 2026-06-12 | Codex 9x (design, adversarial x2, test-coverage, consistency, perf, re-adversarial x3) | 1Crit+6H+6M fixed, 0 open, 1M+1L accepted-XREF | scope: kernel-code-quality

## 3. PCR Read API

- [ ] Implement `tpm2_pcr_read(bank, pcr_mask, out)`.
- [ ] Support SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 banks where active.
- [ ] Add caching for PCR values read during Phase 0.
- [ ] Expose `tpm_pcr_get(index, alg)` to policy consumers.
- [ ] Commit: `"tpm: read PCR values"`

**Test checkpoint:** `tpm2_pcr_read(bank, mask, out)` against QEMU swtpm returns the SHA-256 PCR0 value matching `swtpm`'s state; SHA-1/384/512 banks read where active, absent banks report not-active (not error); a second `tpm_pcr_get(index, alg)` for a Phase-0 value hits the cache (no second TPM transaction). Platforms: QEMU swtpm KVM; bare metal (test laptop fTPM).

## 4. PCR Replay Engine

- [ ] Replay PCR extend operations from parsed event log for every active bank.
- [ ] Compare replayed values against hardware PCR reads.
- [ ] Mark event-log tampering separately from baseline mismatch.
- [ ] Include exact first mismatch in diagnostics.
- [ ] Commit: `"tpm: replay measured boot PCRs"`

**Test checkpoint:** On a clean boot, replayed PCR values (extended from the parsed event log, every active bank) equal the hardware PCR reads from §3; a known-vector unit test replays a fixed log to expected digests; injecting one tampered event-log entry flags `event-log tamper` distinctly from `baseline mismatch` and diagnostics name the exact first-mismatch PCR index + offset. Platforms: kernel known-vector unit tests + QEMU swtpm KVM; bare metal.

## 5. Secure Boot Variable Measurement Reconciliation

- [ ] Decode EV_EFI_VARIABLE_* events for PK, KEK, db, dbx, SecureBoot, SetupMode.
- [ ] Compare measured Secure Boot state with UEFI variables read by TODO-02.
- [ ] Flag impossible combinations such as Secure Boot active but PCR7 missing policy events.
- [ ] Feed results to `boot_integrity_report`.
- [ ] Commit: `"tpm: reconcile Secure Boot measurements"`

**Test checkpoint:** `EV_EFI_VARIABLE_*` events for PK / KEK / db / dbx / SecureBoot / SetupMode decode to the same values the UEFI variables report (read via TODO-02); an injected "SecureBoot active but PCR7 has no policy events" combination is flagged as impossible; the reconciliation result lands in `boot_integrity_report`. Platforms: QEMU swtpm + OVMF Secure Boot KVM; bare metal.

## 6. Baseline Enrollment and Storage

- [ ] Add first-boot enrollment mode gated by physical-console confirmation.
- [ ] Store golden PCR values in UEFI authenticated variable or TPM NV index.
- [ ] Include bootloader hash, kernel hash, Secure Boot state, and firmware version metadata.
- [ ] Support baseline rotation after trusted updates.
- [ ] Commit: `"tpm: enroll measured boot baseline"`

**Test checkpoint:** First-boot enrollment (gated by physical-console confirmation) stores golden PCRs + bootloader hash + kernel hash + Secure Boot state + firmware version; a second boot reads the stored baseline and reports `verified`; a simulated trusted update triggers baseline rotation (old baseline retired, new one stored), not a mismatch halt. Platforms: QEMU swtpm KVM (enrollment + re-boot); bare metal.

## 7. TPM NV Index Support

- [ ] Implement NV read/write/define/undefine for one OS-owned index.
- [ ] Protect baseline with PCR policy where TPM supports it.
- [ ] Handle no-space and locked-NV degraded states.
- [ ] Add migration path from UEFI variable storage to TPM NV.
- [ ] Commit: `"tpm: measured boot NV index storage"`

**Test checkpoint:** Define / read / write / undefine round-trip on one OS-owned NV index against QEMU swtpm; where the TPM supports it the index is PCR-policy-protected (a read under the wrong PCR state is denied); no-space and locked-NV return explicit degraded states (not a wedge); the UEFI-variable -> TPM-NV migration path moves an existing baseline without loss. Platforms: QEMU swtpm KVM; bare metal (test laptop fTPM).

## 8. Sealed-Secret Boot Policy Hooks

- [ ] Add API for sealing and unsealing small secrets to PCR policy.
- [ ] Provide FDE key-unlock hook for future storage encryption.
- [ ] Provide code-integrity policy seal hook.
- [ ] Ensure recovery can prompt when unseal fails.
- [ ] Commit: `"tpm: sealed boot policy hooks"`

**Test checkpoint:** Seal a small secret to a PCR policy, then unseal succeeds while PCRs match and is denied (with a recovery prompt) after a PCR changes; the FDE key-unlock hook and the code-integrity seal hook are present + callable (stub consumers OK until storage-encryption / CI policy land). Platforms: QEMU swtpm KVM (seal + PCR-change deny); bare metal.

## 9. Attestation Report Export

- [ ] Build signed `boot_attestation_report_t` with PCRs, event digest, Secure Boot state, and nonce.
- [ ] Export to `X:\Diag\attestation.json`.
- [ ] Add native query API for user-mode system settings.
- [ ] Add remote-attestation placeholder for platform services.
- [ ] Extend a TPM PCR (target PCR 11, vendor-policy-extensible) with the kernel `.bootproto` manifest sha256 from the bootloader pre-jump path, BEFORE the bootloader transfers control to the kernel. Concretely: in `src/boot/uefi/bootx64.c` after `bootproto_verify_or_reset()` succeeds, walk the EFI_TCG2_PROTOCOL via `LocateProtocol(EFI_TCG2_PROTOCOL_GUID, ...)` and call `Tcg2Protocol->HashLogExtendEvent` with the 32-byte sha256 from the descriptor + a stable event-log entry name (e.g. `IMPOSSIBLE_OS_KERNEL_ABI_MANIFEST`). On success, the bootloader sets `boot_info.caps_present |= BOOT_CAP_MANIFEST_PCR_BOUND` (bit reserved by TODO-01 §11). Failure to extend (no TPM, locality denied, command failure) MUST leave the bit clear and continue boot -- this is a measurement, not a gate. Replay path: §4 PCR replay must include the manifest extend event so a baseline mismatch flags a different kernel-image-vs-manifest pairing, not just a different kernel image. -> XREF: [`01-boot-platform/TODO-01 §11`](TODO-01-boot-protocol-abi-handoff.md#11-capability-negotiation-and-degraded-feature-flags) (item: "Forward-reserve `BOOT_CAP_MANIFEST_PCR_BOUND` (1u<<10) bit").
- [ ] Include the bootloader-to-kernel handoff triple in `boot_attestation_report_t`: ABI manifest sha256 (from `boot_proto_descriptor.sha256`), capability words (`caps_required` / `caps_present` / `caps_degraded`), boot-path provenance (`boot_path` / `boot_reason` / `boot_source_flags` / `boot_fallback_depth`), and bootloader build identity (when TODO-01 §20 ships). Today downstream attestation consumers re-read `g_boot_info` directly which couples them to the live struct layout; the report API decouples by snapshotting the triple at attestation-build time. -> XREF: [`01-boot-platform/TODO-01 §11`](TODO-01-boot-protocol-abi-handoff.md#11-capability-negotiation-and-degraded-feature-flags) caps fields, [`§12`](TODO-01-boot-protocol-abi-handoff.md#12-common-boot-path-provenance-and-decision-record) decision record, [`§17`](TODO-01-boot-protocol-abi-handoff.md#17-bootloader-pre-jump-abi-mismatch-screen) `.bootproto` sha, [`§20`](TODO-01-boot-protocol-abi-handoff.md#20-bootloader-build-identity) bootloader build identity.
- [ ] Reserve forward-compat slots for DRTM (Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement) fields: `drtm_entry_pcr` (typically PCR 17), `drtm_acm_status`, `drtm_measurement_type` (Intel TXT SENTER vs AMD SKINIT vs none). The native `BOOTX64.EFI` does not issue SENTER/SKINIT today, so these fields are zero/absent; the attestation report format must accept and round-trip them so a future TrenchBoot-style Secure Launch adapter (via TODO-08 alternate protocols, or firmware-initiated DRTM on supported platforms) can populate them without a schema break. -> XREF: [`01-boot-platform/TODO-01 §8`](TODO-01-boot-protocol-abi-handoff.md#8-boot-protocol-documentation-and-schema-changelog) owns the `boot_info` handoff-ABI side of any DRTM fields.
- [ ] Commit: `"tpm: export boot attestation report"`

**Test checkpoint:** A signed `boot_attestation_report_t` carries PCRs + event digest + Secure Boot state + nonce and exports to `X:\Diag\attestation.json`; the native query API returns the same snapshot to user-mode; the bootloader manifest PCR-extend (PCR 11) ran pre-jump and set `BOOT_CAP_MANIFEST_PCR_BOUND` (clear + boot-continue when no TPM); the report snapshots the handoff triple (manifest sha256, caps words, boot-path provenance) and round-trips the zeroed DRTM forward-compat slots. Platforms: QEMU swtpm KVM; bare metal.

## 10. Recovery and Mismatch UX

- [ ] Add VPD/boot diagnostics status for verified, no TPM, no baseline, mismatch, and event-log tamper.
- [ ] In recovery, explain whether firmware, bootloader, kernel, Secure Boot db, or baseline changed.
- [ ] Allow trusted baseline reset only from recovery mode with local confirmation.
- [ ] Integrate with A/B rollback if kernel measurement changed unexpectedly.
- [ ] Commit: `"recovery: measured boot mismatch UX"`

**Test checkpoint:** VPD / boot diagnostics show distinct status for verified / no-TPM / no-baseline / mismatch / event-log-tamper; recovery mode names which layer changed (firmware vs bootloader vs kernel vs Secure Boot db vs baseline); a trusted baseline reset is accepted ONLY from recovery mode with local confirmation; an unexpected kernel-measurement change triggers A/B rollback integration (TODO-22). Platforms: manual recovery-mode walkthrough (QEMU swtpm + injected mismatch); bare metal.

## 11. TPM Tests and Event-Log Fixtures

- [ ] Add event-log parser fixtures for TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0.
- [ ] Add PCR replay known-vector tests.
- [ ] Add QEMU swtpm test path.
- [ ] Fake-CRB buffer seam + unit suite for `crb_submit()` in `src/kernel/tpm_transport.c` (cmdReady/START/goIdle, shared cmd/rsp buffer, oversized response) -- the §2 io seam covers TIS only; CRB is validated live via swtpm.
- [ ] Add degraded tests for no TPM, truncated log, and inactive PCR banks.
- [ ] Commit: `"test: TPM measured boot coverage"`

**Test checkpoint:** `scripts\debug\kernel\run-security-tests.bat` (SUITE=security) runs the new TPM suites with 0 failures: TPM 1.2 + 2.0 event-log parser fixtures, PCR-replay known-vector tests, the fake-CRB buffer seam suite for `crb_submit()`, and degraded cases (no TPM, truncated log, inactive banks); the QEMU swtpm path boots green on KVM. Platforms: kernel unit tests + QEMU swtpm KVM; bare metal (test laptop fTPM).
